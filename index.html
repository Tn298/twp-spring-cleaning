  <p>Welcome to a week of spring cleaning with me, your host Thanvi! This week, I took on the arduous journey of cleaning out my storage room, a long overdue task indeed. As I stand at the threshold of this cluttered space, I can't help but feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension. For years, this room has been a symbol of neglect—a repository for forgotten belongings and unfinished projects. But after a recent home renovation, I’m excited to really transform this room into an organized and functional space. My motivation for tackling this task goes beyond just tidying up. I’ve always wanted to have a little studio space in my home—a place where I can organize all of my tools and materials and create a flow state for my creative process. But before I can bring this vision to life, I must confront the clutter that has accumulated over the years. It's a daunting prospect, but I'm determined to see it through.</p>
	
	<h3>IKEA Should Hire Me</h3>
	
<p>We all have those  assortments of spare parts from old assembly projects. Random pieces of specifically designed metal that you have no idea where to put, but you keep it just in case. </p>
	
<h3>OK I Like it Picasso</h3>
	
<p>I'll be honest, I don't really look after my art supplies. I always end up losing a brush, breaking a pencil, or not cleaning up excess paint.</p>
	
<h3>The 2000s Called</h3>
	
<p>Hiding inside the many dusty boxes are some capsules of the past. Old tech and gadgets that I haven't seen in years.</p>

	<p>This week's star item is my old paint palette! This is one of the first paint palettes I bought and has seen me through my many art phases. The last time I used it was last August, and there are still layers of excess paint remaining. I planned to throw it out a while ago anyway, since I'm moving on to using more oil paints than acrylics, and this old plastic doesn't work well for my new projects.</p>

	<p>And that brings us to the end of the week! Throughout this journey, I've learned the value of patience and perseverance. Transforming a cluttered storage room into a functional art studio is no small feat, but with determination and dedication, anything is possible. I've also learned the importance of letting go—of old belongings, yes, but also of outdated beliefs and self-imposed limitations. Spring cleaning isn't just about clearing out physical clutter; it's about creating space for growth and transformation in all areas of life.Thank you for joining me on my journaling process as I record what I find in my storage room. I am really excited to see this room truly transform. Next week I'll continue to update you on the studio's progress. I hope you enjoyed seeing this process!</p>
