		<p>Welcome to a week of spring cleaning with me, your host Thanvi! This week, I took on the arduous journey of cleaning out my storage room, a long overdue task indeed. As I stand at the threshold of this cluttered space, I can't help but feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension. For years, this room has been a symbol of neglect—a repository for forgotten belongings and unfinished projects. But after a recent home renovation, I’m excited to really transform this room into an organized and functional space. My motivation for tackling this task goes beyond just tidying up. I’ve always wanted to have a little studio space in my home—a place where I can organize all of my tools and materials and create a flow state for my creative process. But before I can bring this vision to life, I must confront the clutter that has accumulated over the years. It's a daunting prospect, but I'm determined to see it through.</p>
		
		<p>As I sift through the boxes of miscellaneous items, I’m finding some interesting things. Many of these items are really old; some items are from when I was in elementary school, the early 2000s, or even farther back than that. Some items hold sentimental value, so I’m careful with how I discard them. Others are just a random assortment of wires, tools, and junk. As Thill states, “ The flood of things to keep or discard complicates our notions of interest and attention…,” items of sentimental value are harder to let go of, and yet they no longer serve purpose for me, and just end up collecting dust in a corner of this room. This project isn't just about cleaning out a room; it's about reclaiming a space. As I organize my belongings and envision the layout of the studio, I'm reminded of Marie Kondo’s lifestyle philosophy, the Konmari method. It's a lesson in self-care and self-discovery—a reminder to prioritize the things that bring me joy and fulfillment. Her method made me realize that it's not just about decluttering; it's about curating a space that reflects my present self and my aspirations for the future. As I discard the unnecessary and organize the essentials, I'm struck by the cathartic nature of the process.</p>
